## Pull Request Guidelines

- Try not to exceed 200 LOC +- in a single PR.
- Avoid whitespace-only or other trivial changes that do not change logic.

The best thing you can do is to keep commits and PRs contextual. Small PRs
are great, as they're easy to review and approve. Large, multi-faceted PRs
are more difficult to review, and may get rejected for one portion,though
other portions would have been accepted if they were independent.

A PR should generally have a purpose other than "fixing code"; changing
lines just for the sake of style or syntax obscures the commit history of a
file. In other words, the why of a line of code's existence can usually be
determined by the comments in the previous commit for that line and those
around it - git blame is used to see why a change was made, understand the
context, and determine if, and how it can/should be modified. To change
code simply for the sake of whitespace, or re-arranging lines is frowned
upon, because it unnecessarily hides/buries history.
